# Distributing Your Python Application

## Overview

Python is now widely used in our field. Many applications are developed within our laboratories and research teams using this language. But are these developments shared with the community? What is the necessary cost in time and effort to make your work available? What are the benefits?

In this workshop, we will cover what a Python package is and then provide an overview of the tools that help maintain it in a stable and robust state (linter, tests, etc.). We will then discuss the steps to make it understandable to the largest audience possible, thereby promoting interactions (documentation, tutorial, etc.). Finally, we will address the issues related to making the tool available through package management systems like pip or conda.

## Workshop Structure

This workshop consists of a presentation supported by a practical session that will allow you to assemble all these pieces on a toy application. We will rely on tools available on GitHub, so an account will be necessary to participate in the workshop.

### Topics Covered:

1. **Introduction to Python Packages**
   - Definition and importance
   - Basic structure of a Python package

2. **Maintaining a Stable and Robust Package**
   - Linting tools
   - Testing frameworks
   - Continuous Integration (CI) workflows

3. **Making Your Package Understandable**
   - Writing effective documentation
   - Creating tutorials and examples

4. **Distributing Your Package**
   - Using pip and PyPI
   - Using conda and Anaconda Cloud

### Practical Session:

During the hands-on part, we will:
- Create a simple Python package
- Set up linting and testing
- Write basic documentation
- Publish the package on GitHub and PyPI

### Requirements:

- A GitHub account
- Basic knowledge of Python programming

We hope this workshop will help you understand the full lifecycle of a Python package and encourage you to share your developments with the broader community. Happy coding!
